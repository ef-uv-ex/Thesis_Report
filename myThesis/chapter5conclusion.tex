	Choosing models based on the highest accruacy value did not prove to be a good approach. Models showed a tendency to fixate on specific targets, which gave a higher overall evaluation but a much lower ability to generalize.

	Strong cross-correlation in the training data created confusion in the models ability to classify targets. Given the strong cross correaltion between multiple targets, over multiple angles, the model was not able to create a generalized set of weights that allowed it to accurately make predictions.

	Placing the models into a siamese network exacerbated the tendencancy towards target fixation.
