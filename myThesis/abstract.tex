The proliferation of \gls{LO} aircraft and \gls{ECM} will complicate the ability of radar systems to accurately identify adversary aircraft. Advances in machine learning are enabling sensors to better identify patterns in signal data, and make more informed decisions. This paper investigates the classification accuracy of XX \gls{ML} models as compared to a traditional matched filter receiver. The ML models have been pretrained using a model based approach. Simulated \gls{RCS} data for XX targets was created using Altair's CADFeko \gls{ESIM} software. Models used for the ESIM are simplified 3D CAD models based on physical targets. Simulation data was forked into two training sets: a feature-based set that feeds the raw RCS data to the ML model; and a probability based set that creates causal PDFs using the mean and variance over frequency. The trained models are tested using measurement data collected in \gls{AFIT}'s indoor compact radar range. Classification accuracy for each ML model will be reported in a confusion matrix along with a corresponding F-1 number. Accuracy metrics are used to create a \gls{ROC} plot for each target.
